      Money Cat Records is a Brooklyn-based record label started by friends who
      asked me to make a site for them. They asked for a CMS to add mixes /
      radio shows and gave me full control on design / dev. I built the site
      using Gatsby & Netlify CMS and something fun happens when you hover over
      the labels on the home page ;)
