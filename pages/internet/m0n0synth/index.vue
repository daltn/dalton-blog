      m0n0synth was built during a hackathon in 2018 using React, the Web Audio
      API, and Tone.js for the feedback delay. I love playing synthesizers so
      realizing that I already had one in my browser through the Web Audio API
      led me down a fun path towards a single oscillator synth w/ an
      oscilloscope and a feedback delay :)
