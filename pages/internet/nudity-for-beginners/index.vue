      for his album, Nudity for Beginners. This piece was influenced by the idea
      of nudity as a metaphor for emotional vulnerability. A bank of questions
      are shuffled and three of them are displayed. These questions examine the
      ideas of ego & are a reflection on what it means to be human. The answers
      are then embedded & animated as a part of the music video.
