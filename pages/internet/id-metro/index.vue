      I helped build out the redesigned sites of Interior Design & Metropolis
      Magazine. These sites were made using customized versions of Wordpress'
      <a

        rel="noopener noreferrer"

      >
        Gutenberg Editor</a
      >
      blocks. We utilized a shared repository between both sites since dev
      happened simultaneously. We ripped open the source code of gutenberg and
      enjoyed using the functional patterns that the code base is built from to
      create our own blocks. Shout out to Wordpress being open source. We built
      out a templating system to display over a decade's worth of legacy content
      while creating an avenue to enter the modular editing experience of
      Gutenberg. A cute moment is the red scrollbar I sprinkled into Metro ;)
