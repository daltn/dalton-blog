      I helped build out the redesigned sites of Interior Design & Metropolis
      Magazine. These sites are built using customized versions of Wordpress'
      Gutenberg blocks. We utilized a shared repository between both sites since
      dev happened simultaneously. We ripped open the source code of Gutenberg
      and enjoyed using the functional patterns that the code base is built from
      to create our own blocks. Shout out to Wordpress being open source. We
      migrated over 1 million images and built out a templating system for all
      of their legacy content. A cute moment is the red scrollbar I sprinkled
      into Metro ;)
