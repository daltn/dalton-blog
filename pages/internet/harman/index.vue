    <p>
      I helped build out a 3D web app for Harman's annual explore conference
      where they showcase their new audio products. The renderings were done in
      unreal engine and from there each frame was fed into a React app that
      scrubs through each frame using your scroll position. We built out
      multi-axis interactive moments and I handled building out UI elements and
      making an app w/ a high CPU load function smoothly. The link above
      showcases the desktop experience.
