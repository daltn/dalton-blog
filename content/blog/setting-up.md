I've compiled a list of sites, tools, and extensions I've enjoyed using for anyone looking to get started on their own software development journey.

### Learning

Developing software means learning to learn. Visualization and teaching are the most direct ways to create new neural pathways. [Limitless](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781401958237) by Jim Kwik is a fantastic book to kickstart your learning journey. Create projects you'd want to use to cement your skills and ensure to sprinkle [fun](https://media.giphy.com/media/26ufl1ASleVkA7wIg/giphy.mp4) into whatever you're doing.

### Tutorials

- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- [Level Up](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/)

### Reading & Listening

- [dev.to](https://dev.to/)
- [CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/)
- [Syntax FM](https://syntax.fm/)

### Playing & Prototyping

Sites for when I want to play around or prototype an idea and not config a local dev environment:

- [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)
- [Replit](https://replit.com/)
- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)

### Terminal

I use the mac terminal w/ [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) with [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/). Shout out to [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) as a more fully featured option.

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to download system packages

### Source Control

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is installed with the Xcode CLI tools which is my source control for code changes. [Github](https://github.com/) is where I push those changes to collaborate with others. I use [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) at work which is also fantastic and offers free private repos. Github is a better place to start on IMO since the open source community is centered around it. You can learn so much from looking at / working on open source software so def have fun with that :)

### Text Editor

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is fantastic. I love the git tooling where I can clearly review all my changes before committing them and the plethora of extensions that are available.

Extensions:

- [Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme)
- [Material Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)
- [EsLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
- [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer)
- [Import Cost](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost)

### Browsers

You'll want to get familiar with the dev tools in your browser of choice and have multiple browsers to QA your apps on. Get extensions for viewing JSON, React / Vue Dev Tool extensions, and an ad blocker while you're at it ;)

- [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/)
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

### Servers

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is the truth for hosting static sites and a cute place to get started. It has a massive free tier and helpful tooling through a pleasent interface.

Once you want to start playing around with storing content in a database and creating an API to access it you'll want to explore cloud services such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home), or [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

have fun!
