Welcome to the blog y'all

I'm an artist, musician, & software developer.

I enjoy learning about science, computers, nutrition, and how to live an energized, beautiful life with each moment. My fam is Argentinean and I grew up in Miami - ya t√∫ sabes ;) I reside in Brooklyn and I thrive off the vibrancy of NYC. I've been involved with creating and playing dance music for most of my life and I'm passionate about the healing sonic forces that ripple through our bodies in the dance. I'll be using this blog as a place to share what I'm currently exploring.
